## Inventory Tracker (TypeScript)
- In this lab we created a simple inventory tracker. This helped me understand how classes, inheritance, and polymorphism work.

# How it works
- I made three main files:

    Product.ts – base class 

    PhysicalProduct.ts – adds weight and tax

    DigitalProduct.ts – adds file size and no tax

Then I used main.ts to test everything.

# How to run it
1. Open in VS Code
2. Run commands 
    - npm install 
    - npx tsc 
    - node dist/main.js
